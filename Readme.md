# ‚úÖ To-Do List Application:

A **Command-Line To-Do List Application** developed in Python. This project aimed to reinforce fundamental Python skills through the application of functions, conditionals, loops, error handling, and input validation.

---

## üìå Project Overview:

This project showcases the capability to:

- Develop an interactive command-line interface (CLI)
- Organize and manage data with a Python list
- Manage user input and errors effectively
- Organize code using functions and adhere to documentation best practices

---

## üß† Key Concepts Practiced:

- Syntax and Data Types in Python
- Functions and Loops
- Exception Management (`try/except/else/finally`)
- Control Flow and Input Verification
- Code Structure and Clarity (including comments and docstrings)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:

Upon executing the script, users see a main menu where they can select to:

1. **Add a Task**
2. **View Current Tasks**
3. **Delete a Task**
4. **Exit the Application**

The tasks are kept in a Python list and initially filled with 3 sample tasks for testing purposes.

## üìÇ File Structure:

```
todo_list.py       # Main Python script
README.md          # Project documentation
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Extra Functionalities Added:

- Preloaded sample tasks for demo purposes
- Title-casing task names automatically
- Task deletion confirmation (with `y/n`)
- Exit confirmation (with `y/n`)
- Graceful return to menu after every action

## üîç Learnings:

_Productivity Optimization:_ Reconfigured VS Code keybindings to streamline development workflow. Instead of relying on mouse navigation, I now use keyboard shortcuts to run Python files, open terminals, and manage tasks‚Äîboosting overall efficiency.

_Terminal Management:_ Encountered issues when trying to rerun Python files after making changes. To resolve this, I customized keybindings to kill the current terminal or all terminals, allowing for a clean reset without restarting the entire IDE.

_Command Line Proficiency:_ Gained hands-on experience using the Bash terminal for creating, editing, and deleting files with commands such as touch, code, and rm. For example:

- `touch script.py && code $_` ‚Äì Quickly create and open a new Python file in VS Code.
- `rm script.py` ‚Äì Delete a file from the terminal.

_Version Control:_ Utilized Git and GitHub for version tracking, committing changes, and hosting the project repository.

## üìú Resources:

_Video Tutorials:_ Followed walkthroughs by Jeremy Alkire and Steven Ceglarek, which provided helpful guidance on structuring the project and understanding key Python concepts.

_AI Support:_ Leveraged ChatGPT as a learning companion to clarify concepts, assist with debugging, and improve code quality.

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements:

_Refactoring for Reusability:_ The current code can be optimized by creating additional utility functions to handle common tasks such as input validation, formatting, and confirmation prompts. This would reduce redundancy and make the codebase cleaner, more modular, and easier to maintain.

## ‚úÖ Final Notes

This project meets and exceeds the core requirements. All functionalities are tested, and the application is ready to run as-is. The code is structured with clear logic and includes ample inline comments/documentation.
